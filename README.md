To run, simply open the entire folder in your IDE and run the main.py file.
You will need the latest Python version and these libraries as well: pillow, openai, flask

To install the libraries, you can simply type the following into your Command Prompt / Terminal:

pip install pillow, openai, flask

**NOTE** The "static" folder should not be altered as Flask has a strict file structure!

Your directory should flow as follows:
 TrAIn>
      static>
            jpg
            jpg
            jpg
            jpg
            jpg
      main.py
      README.md
